Font_hiba:

System.InvalidOperationException: 'No appropriate font found for family name 'Arial'. Implement IFontResolver and assign to 'GlobalFontSettings.FontResolver' to use fonts. See https://docs.pdfsharp.net/link/font-resolving.html'

Github copilot ajánlás:
The error occurs because the GlobalFontSettings.FontResolver is not set, 
and the PdfSharp library cannot find the specified font ("Arial") to use in the XFont constructor. 
This is evident from the exception message and the fact that GlobalFontSettings.FontResolver is null. 
The PdfSharp library requires a font resolver to locate and load fonts, especially when the default system fonts are unavailable or not embedded.
To fix this issue, you need to implement the IFontResolver interface and assign it to GlobalFontSettings.FontResolver. 
This will allow you to specify how fonts are resolved and loaded.

Suggested Fix:
1.	Implement a custom font resolver by creating a class that implements PdfSharp.Fonts.IFontResolver.
2.	Assign your custom font resolver to GlobalFontSettings.FontResolver in the application initialization code.

Example:
public class CustomFontResolver : IFontResolver
{
    public byte[] GetFont(string faceName)
    {
        // Load font data from resources or files
        return File.ReadAllBytes("path_to_font_file.ttf");
    }

    public FontResolverInfo ResolveTypeface(string familyName, bool isBold, bool isItalic)
    {
        // Map the requested font to a specific font file
        return new FontResolverInfo("Arial");
    }
}

// In your application startup code
GlobalFontSettings.FontResolver = new CustomFontResolver();
